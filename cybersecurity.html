      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting or safeguarding systems, servers, networks, data and programs from cyber attacks or unauthorised access and ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information. It is also known as Information security. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at exploiting or destroying sensitive information, extortion of money from people etc.
        Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is a very challenging task in today's world as attackers are becoming more innovative day by day.
        <br><br>

        <h1>History of Cyber Security</h1>
        <p>
          The history of cyber security started with a research project on what what known as the ARPANET (The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). A man named Bob Thomas found out that it was possible for a computer program to move across a network, leaving a small trail wherever it went.
          <br>
          He named the program Creeper and designed it to travel between Tenex terminals on the early ARPANET, printing the message <a style="color: #fd6b54;" target="_blank;" href="https://corewar.co.uk/creeper.htm">"I'M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN."</a><br>
          A man named Ray Tomlinson, who invented email, saw this idea and liked it. He tinkered with the program and made it self-replicatingâ€”the first computer worm. Then he wrote another program called Reaper, the first antivirus software which would chase Creeper and delete it.
          <br><br>
          Later in 1988, an American computer scientist named Robert Morris wanted to check the size of the internet. He wrote a program for testing the size of the internet. This program went through networks, invaded Unix terminals using a known bug and copied itself. The program became the first network virus and was named as Moris worm.This was also the first cyber attack ever. The Morris worm could have infected a computer multiple times as it replicated very aggressively and each process would slow the machine down eventually to the point of being damaged. Robert Morris was the first person to be charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The act led to the formation of the Computer Emergency Response Team. This is a non-profit research centre for issues that could affect the internet as a whole.  <br><br>
          </p>

          <h1>Importance of Cyber Security</h1>
          <p>
            In today's world, we are dependent upon technology for everything. The government, businesses and the common man store almost all their sensitive data or information on their systems or computers and transmit it from one system to another scross networks.
            A data breach can have devastating consequences for any business or an individual.A data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations.On an average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million.
            Thus to avoid such breaches and attacks it is essential to implement a strong cybersecurity approach.
