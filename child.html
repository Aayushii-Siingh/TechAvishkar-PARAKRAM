       The internet, being a global network with billions of computers is considered an essential survival kit for the younger generation today. With the possibility of almost accessing any kind of information or the ability to almost communicate with anyone around the world, the network sure can have a dark side, unless handled with maturity and responsibility. 
In today’s world we are well aware of the consequences of sharing our personal information online as there are increasing risks of our data being misused, the data being in the form of songs, your chat, videos and even money for instance. Now more than ever, we understand the importance of safety, both online and in the real world. The coronavirus pandemic has forced millions of families from across the globe to adopt social distancing and rely on their Internet-enabled devices to communicate with the outside world, friends and family. It’s essential for schools and institutions to organise talks and workshops on cyber safety to keep children updated about the dark side of the web which will help them surf the internet in a smarter way.

        <br><br>

        <h1>Cyber Security Awareness</h1>
        <p>
          A simple mobile phone is enough to access the internet. But deep within the internet lies the alarming truth where evil strangers, hackers, predators and criminals are on the look out for naïve and young users. The Internet without a doubt can be a wonderful platform for kids, but online access can come with risks like inappropriate content, cyberbullying etc. Increased internet use could make children targets for sexual exploitation too. It is essential to have a presence of mind while surfing online.
         The whole concept of high school and middle school revolves around popularity and fame, and this is very well represented in some of the recent streaming shows online. Social media plays a big role in order for teenagers to gain that kind exposure or fame, but however tempting it might be it’s a necessary rule to NOT accept stranger’s requests online. Unknown online entities posing as friends are always on the look out to catfish and it puts you at a risk of getting your accounts cloned as pretty much of your information is available to them. It is always important to be sure about the person before you share any kind of personal information as it could be used against you at any time.
          <br><br>
          It is also super important to be mindful of what we share online, as it is not necessary for the whole world to know our every move. It is always a good idea to ask a trusted friend of what private information they can see on your sites and if it’s something that makes you unhappy, please feel free to have the strictest privacy setting for your posts and profile in general.  <br><br>
          </p>

          <h1>Ways to stay safe</h1>
          <p>
            Always be cautious about what you do online, which sites you visit, and what you share. Use comprehensive security software, and make sure to backup your data on a regular basis in case something goes wrong. By taking preventative measures, you can save yourself from headaches later on. 
            <br><br>
            <strong style="color: #fd6b54;">Let’s begin with passwords: </strong>
It’s necessary for online accounts to have secure passwords. Most kids play online games and set up accounts, allowing them to engage in interactions with other players. However, the dangers of data breaches are not limited to financial accounts, and any user database is useful for cyber thieves. 
<br>
<strong style="color: #fd6b54;">Be mindful: </strong>
Kids may feel pressured to share their thoughts, feelings and images on social media and may be asked to provide personal details in order to access games and apps. But it’s important to stay cautious online as once something is out there in the public domain, it can’t be taken back.
It’s important for all of us to remember that we might feel comfortable sharing something now, but this could change in the future. It is always a good idea to consult an adult before sharing certain information online.
<br>
<strong style="color: #fd6b54;">Reading Privacy policies: </strong>
Often ignored, but it is an important step to stay safe. Read the notices and policies to understand how information about the students or any user is being collected and how the following will be used and protected.
Although most terms and conditions are lengthy and confusing, they contain important information about your privacy rights.
<br>
<strong style="color: #fd6b54;">Lookout for the latest frauds and click smart: </strong>
It’s a healthy practice to keep ourselves updated on current happenings around us. The most common types of online fraud being phishing and spoofing. Phishing is the process of collecting your personal information through e-mails or websites claiming to be legitimate. This information can include usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. Spam emails, phony “free” offers, click bait, online quizzes and more all use these tactics to entice you to click on dangerous links or give up your personal information. Always be wary of offers that sound too good to be true, or ask for too much information.
When shopping online, or visiting websites for online banking or other sensitive transactions, always make sure that the site’s address starts with “https”, instead of just “http”, and has a padlock icon in the URL field. This indicates that the website is secure and uses encryption to scramble your data so it can’t be intercepted by others.
Keeping the software updated can help you stay safer as it protects the computer from incoming threats, destroys and warns of possible threats to the system.
